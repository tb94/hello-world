# hello-world

    Hey there, 

    This is my first personal repository!
    I decided that I need more exposure in my field, side projects that interest me, and a good way to keep track off all of my projects.
    Currently I am a CS student, expecting to graduate in May, working a software engineer internship for a web app.
    Besides PHP, JS, CSS, and HTML, I'm also interested in Assembler and Java/Android, and I have experience in c++/c#, swift, but I would like to expand my skills to new areas.
    Thanks for checking this out!,
